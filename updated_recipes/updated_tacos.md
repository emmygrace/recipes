A family favorite for taco night! Crispy corn shells filled with your choice of black beans or seasoned ground beef and topped with a variety of fresh and cheesy toppings. Serves 4

## Ingredients
- 2 cans black beans, drained and rinsed, or 1 pound ground beef (92% lean) 
- 1 packet taco seasoning (or homemade)
- 8–12 crispy corn taco shells
- Shredded cheese
- Lettuce, shredded
- Store-bought salsa
- Sour cream
- Fresh diced jalapeños
- Black olives, sliced

#### Sides:
- 1 can refried beans
- 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (for beans)
- Store-bought Spanish rice (microwaveable)

1. For **black beans**: Heat beans in a skillet with taco seasoning and a splash of water, cooking until warmed through and coated with seasoning.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange taco shells on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes until warm and crispy. Do not use a toaster oven (fire hazard!).
3. Heat refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl for 1-2 minutes. Stir in shredded mozzarella cheese and heat for another 30 seconds or until melted.
4. Place the taco shells in a taco stand for easy filling and serving.
5. Plate with refried beans and Spanish rice on the side for a complete meal.## Notes
- **Taco Stand**: A taco stand keeps the shells upright for easy assembly and makes serving less messy.
- **Toppings**: Feel free to add guacamole, chopped tomatoes, or diced onions for variety.
- **Storage**: Store leftover taco meat or beans in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet or microwave.
