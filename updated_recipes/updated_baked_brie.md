A deliciously gooey and festive appetizer, perfect for holiday gatherings or special occasions.

## Ingredients
- 1 round brie
- 1 cup cranberry sauce
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 egg (for egg wash)
- Crackers, for serving

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
2. Spread the cranberry sauce evenly over the top of the brie.
3. Beat the egg and brush it over the folded puff pastry to help it turn golden brown during baking.
4. Place the wrapped brie on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
5. Let the baked brie rest for 5-10 minutes before serving to allow the cheese to settle.## Notes
- **Make It Your Own**: Substitute cranberry sauce with apricot jam, fig preserves, or honey for a different flavor profile.
- **Garnish**: Add a sprinkle of chopped nuts (like pecans or walnuts) to the cranberry sauce for added texture.
