A simple and elegant side dish featuring tender green beans, buttery almonds, and a hint of garlic and lemon.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound green beans, trimmed
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Lemon juice, to taste

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for another 1 minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
4. Add the green beans to the skillet and toss to coat in the buttery almond mixture.
5. Transfer to a serving dish and enjoy immediately.## Notes
- **Make Ahead**: Blanch the green beans a day ahead and store them in the refrigerator. Sauté with the almond mixture just before serving.
- **Variations**: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat or top with grated Parmesan for extra flavor.
