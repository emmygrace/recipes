A quick and satisfying meal or snack with crispy tortillas and gooey, melted cheese. Perfect for any time of day! Serves 4

## Ingredients 
- 4 large flour tortillas
- 2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)

1. Heat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat and spray lightly with cooking spray.
2. Place one tortilla on the griddle and cook for 20-30 seconds, then flip and cook for another 20-30 seconds until the tortilla is lightly browned.
3. Spread shredded cheese evenly over the entire tortilla. Add any optional fillings, such as cooked chicken, black beans, diced green chiles, or sautéed vegetables.
4. Fold the tortilla in half and press gently with a spatula. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the cheese is fully melted and the tortilla is golden brown.
5. Remove the quesadilla from the skillet and let cool slightly. Slice into wedges and serve with sour cream, guacamole, or salsa.
6. Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and cheese.## Notes
- **Crispier Quesadillas**: Press gently with a spatula while cooking to achieve a crispier texture.
- **Cheese Options**: Experiment with different cheeses like mozzarella, pepper jack, or a Mexican blend for unique flavors.
- **Storage**: Leftover quesadillas can be refrigerated for up to 2 days and reheated in a skillet or toaster oven for best results.
- **Optional Fillings**: Try cooked chicken, black beans, diced green chiles, or sautéed onions and peppers for variety.
