Perfect for salmon, this zesty and herbaceous marinade enhances the natural flavors of the fish with a tangy lemon base and fragrant herbs.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon basil
- 1 tablespoon rosemary
- 1 tablespoon parsley
- 1 tablespoon thyme
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper

## Notes
- This marinade works well for other proteins like chicken or tofu and even as a salad dressing.
- If using dried herbs instead of fresh, reduce the quantity by half (e.g., 1/2 tablespoon dried herbs).
- To prevent cross-contamination, do not reuse the marinade that has come into contact with raw fish; instead, set some aside before marinating.
