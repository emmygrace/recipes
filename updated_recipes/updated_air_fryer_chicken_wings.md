## Ingredients
- 1-2 pounds chicken wings
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons corn starch
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons pepper
- 2 teaspoons garlic salt
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- 2 tablespoons hot sauce

1. In a large bowl, pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels.
2. Remove the wings from the refrigerator. Add the salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, smoked paprika, EVOO, and hot sauce to the bowl. Toss to coat the wings evenly.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F.

- **For Extra Crispiness**: Patting the wings dry and using baking powder are key to achieving a crispy texture.

- **Variations**: Customize with your favorite wing sauces or dry rubs after cooking.
