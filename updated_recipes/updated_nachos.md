A quick and delicious meal or snack, loaded with layers of black beans or seasoned ground beef, melted cheese, and your favorite toppings.

## Ingredients (Serves 4)
#### Base:
- Tortilla chips (enough to cover a large baking sheet)

#### Toppings:
- 1 pound ground beef (92% lean) or 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 packet taco seasoning (or homemade)
- 2/3 cup water (for beef, per seasoning packet directions)
- 2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)
- Lettuce, shredded
- Store-bought salsa
- Sour cream
- Fresh diced jalapeños
- Black olives, sliced

1. For **black beans**: Heat beans in a skillet with taco seasoning and a splash of water, cooking until warmed through and coated with seasoning.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
3. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
4. Remove the nachos from the oven. Top with shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream, diced jalapeños, and sliced black olives.
5. Serve immediately on the baking sheet or transfer to a large serving platter. Provide additional toppings on the side for customization.## Notes
- **Cheese Tip**: For extra gooeyness, layer chips, cheese, and toppings in two layers before baking.
- **Customizable**: Add guacamole, diced tomatoes, or chopped onions for additional flavors.
- **Perfect for Sharing**: Serve straight from the baking sheet for an easy, crowd-friendly presentation.
