Creamy, buttery mashed potatoes with a rich texture, perfect as a side dish for any meal.

## Ingredients
- 5 pounds potatoes (russet or Yukon gold recommended)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 12 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper, to taste

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
2. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Once cool enough to handle, scoop the insides into a large bowl.
3. In a small saucepan, gently heat the heavy cream and butter until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm.
4. Pour the cream and butter mixture into the mashed potatoes. Gently fold until combined, being careful not to overmix.## Notes
- **Tips for Creaminess**: For extra smooth potatoes, use a potato ricer or food mill instead of mashing.
- **Variations**: Add roasted garlic, chives, or grated Parmesan for additional flavor.
- **Make Ahead**: Keep mashed potatoes warm in a slow cooker or reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of cream or milk.
