A family tradition enjoyed on Christmas, this recipe creates a perfectly tender and flavorful prime rib, cooked to medium-rare perfection.

## Ingredients
- 2-3 lb standing prime rib roast (bone-in or boneless)
- Salt and pepper (for dry brine)

### Additional Details
#### **Choosing the Cut**:
- Look for a well-marbled rib roast from the **prime** or **choice** grades for the best flavor and tenderness.
- Bone-in rib roasts offer more flavor and help insulate the meat during cooking for even doneness. However, boneless is easier to slice.
- Purchase from a reputable butcher or high-quality grocery store. Dry-aged beef is an excellent option if available.

#### **Dry Brining**:
- Dry brining enhances flavor and tenderness by allowing the salt to penetrate the meat.
- Generously coat the roast with salt and pepper, ensuring all sides are covered.
- Place the roast on a rack over a baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered for 24 hours. This dries the surface for better browning.

1. Remove the roast from the refrigerator 2 hours before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature. This ensures even cooking.
2. Preheat the oven to 250°F.
3. Remove the roast from the oven and tent loosely with foil. Let it rest for 20-30 minutes. During this time, the temperature will rise slightly due to carryover cooking.
4. Increase the oven temperature to 500°F. Place the roast back in the oven for about 10 minutes to develop a beautifully browned crust.
5. Allow the roast to rest for another 10 minutes before slicing. Use a sharp carving knife to cut thin slices against the grain.## Notes
- Adjust cooking times for larger or smaller roasts; aim for 30 minutes per pound at 250°F.
- Leftovers make excellent sandwiches with horseradish sauce or can be repurposed in soups and stews.
