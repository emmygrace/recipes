A creamy and fluffy omelet perfect for family breakfasts or sleepovers. Customize it with your favorite toppings! Serves 3

## Ingredients 
- 4-5 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste

1. Crack the eggs into a bowl.
2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add cooking spray or butter.
3. Sprinkle your desired toppings (e.g., cheese, vegetables, meats) evenly over one half of the omelet.
4. Use the spatula to gently fold the omelet in half over the toppings.## Notes
- **Healthier Option**: Using some egg whites reduces cholesterol and calories while keeping the omelet fluffy. Whisking heavy cream adds richness even when yolks are reduced.
- **Pro Tip**: Pre-cook raw toppings like mushrooms or peppers to remove excess moisture and enhance their flavor.
- **Customizable**: Each person can pick their own toppings for a personalized omelet experience.
