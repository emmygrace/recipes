## Ingredients 
- 2 cups pancake mix
- 1 1/2 cup almond milk
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- 2 eggs

1. In a medium bowl, combine the pancake mix, almond milk, oil, and egg. Use an electric mixer or whisk to beat the batter until smooth and no lumps remain.
2. Place a Lodge cast iron flat griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with cooking spray.
3. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
4. Stack the pancakes and serve warm with your favorite toppings.## Notes
- For a thicker batter, reduce almond milk slightly; for thinner pancakes, add a splash more.
- Extra batter can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to **24 hours**. Stir gently before using, and if it thickens, add a small splash of almond milk to return it to the desired consistency.
- These pancakes also freeze well. Let them cool completely, then stack with parchment paper in between and store in an airtight container.
