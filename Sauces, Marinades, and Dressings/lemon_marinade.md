## Lemon Marinade

_By Emmy Clark_  
Perfect for salmon, this zesty and herbaceous marinade enhances the natural flavors of the fish with a tangy lemon base and fragrant herbs.

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon basil
- 1 tablespoon rosemary
- 1 tablespoon parsley
- 1 tablespoon thyme
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper

### Directions
1. Combine all ingredients in a jar or blend with an immersion blender until smooth and well-emulsified.
2. Use immediately or store in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 1 week.
3. For salmon, marinate the fish for at least 30 minutes before cooking. Reserve some marinade separately for basting during cooking.

### Notes
- This marinade works well for other proteins like chicken or tofu and even as a salad dressing.
- If using dried herbs instead of fresh, reduce the quantity by half (e.g., 1/2 tablespoon dried herbs).
- To prevent cross-contamination, do not reuse the marinade that has come into contact with raw fish; instead, set some aside before marinating.
