## Red Wine Au Jus

A rich and flavorful sauce that perfectly complements prime rib or other roasted meats.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups red wine
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions
1. **Combine Ingredients**:
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the red wine, beef broth, shallot, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper.
   - Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.

2. **Reduce the Sauce**:
   - Lower the heat to a simmer and allow the liquid to reduce by half.The process can take 10-20 minutes, depending on the amount of liquid and the desired consistency.

3. **Strain**:
   - Once reduced, strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the solids, leaving a smooth liquid.

4. **Finish with Butter**:
   - Return the strained liquid to the saucepan. Over low heat, whisk in the butter until melted and the sauce is glossy.

5. **Serve**:
   - Serve warm with your roasted meats or as a dipping sauce.

### Notes
- **Tips for Success**:
  - Use a good-quality red wine you enjoy drinking, as it heavily influences the flavor.
  - Adjust seasoning after reducing since the flavors, including saltiness, will intensify.
- **Variations**: Add a splash of balsamic vinegar for a slightly sweet tang or fresh herbs for extra aroma.
