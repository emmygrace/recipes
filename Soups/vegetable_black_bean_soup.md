## Vegetable Black Bean Soup

_By Emmy Clark_  
Inspired by Amy's Vegetable Black Bean Soup. Their website mentions "We first tasted this soup in a lovely little restaurant in Puerto Escondido, Mexico – and begged the owner for the recipe. It’s rich in flavor from vegetables and organic black beans, a good source of fiber." Serves 4 

### Ingredients
- **Base Ingredients**:
  - 3 cans black beans, drained and rinsed
  - 3 cups (24oz) vegetable broth
  - 1 can corn, drained and rinsed
  - 1 can unseasoned cooked potatoes, drained and rinsed  
- **Vegetables**:
  - 1 large red onion, chopped
  - 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
  - 2 celery ribs, diced
  - 1 jalapeno pepper, deseeded and diced
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
- **Seasonings**:
  - 2 teaspoons ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon paprika
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- **Other**:
  - 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

### Preparation
1. **Black Beans**:
   - Drain and rinse the black beans in a strainer.
2. **Vegetables**:
   - Slice the onion, carrot, celery, and jalapeno in a food processor if desired. Lightly chop using the pulse function for a consistent dice.
3. **Spices**:
   - Measure the garlic, cumin, paprika, coriander, and salt into a small prep bowl for easy use during cooking.

### Directions
1. **Sauté Vegetables**:
   - Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and jalapeno. Sauté for 3-5 minutes until softened and fragrant.
2. **Toast Spices**:
   - Stir in the cumin, paprika, and coriander. Cook for 1 minute to toast the spices and deepen their flavor.
3. **Simmer the Soup**:
   - Add the black beans and vegetable broth. Stir and bring to a boil.
   - Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 15 minutes.
4. **Blend**:
   - Using an immersion blender, puree the soup a few times to achieve a mix of creamy and chunky textures.
5. **Finish with Lime Juice**:
   - Stir in the lime juice. Adjust seasoning with salt if needed.
6. **Serve**:
   - Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh cilantro, if desired.
   - Serve with crusty bread, sour cream, avocado, freshly grated cheese, tortilla chips, or over rice.

### Notes
- **Potatoes**: Alternatively, use frozen potatoes—thawed and cooked briefly—or refrigerated potatoes brought to room temperature. Frozen potatoes should be thawed and cooked briefly in boiling water. Refrigerated potatoes should be brought to room temperature before adding to the soup.
- **Optional Garnishes**: Customize with toppings like chopped green onions, diced tomatoes, or a dollop of Greek yogurt for added flavor and texture.
