## Fluffy Omelet

_By Emmy Clark_  
A creamy and fluffy omelet perfect for family breakfasts or sleepovers. Customize it with your favorite toppings! Serves 3

### Ingredients 
- 4-5 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Eggs**:
   - Crack the eggs into a bowl.
   - Whisk the eggs (and whites, if using) with the heavy cream, salt, and pepper until smooth and slightly frothy.

2. **Cook the Omelet**:
   - Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add cooking spray or butter.
   - Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and let it cook undisturbed for about 1 minute.
   - Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the omelet, allowing uncooked egg to flow underneath.

3. **Add Toppings**:
   - Sprinkle your desired toppings (e.g., cheese, vegetables, meats) evenly over one half of the omelet.
   - Continue cooking 2-3 minutes until the eggs are set but still slightly soft on top.

4. **Fold and Serve**:
   - Use the spatula to gently fold the omelet in half over the toppings.
   - Slide it onto a plate and serve immediately.

### Optional Toppings
- **Cheese**: Shredded cheddar, mozzarella, or crumbled feta
- **Vegetables**: Saut√©ed mushrooms, chopped spinach, diced green peppers, or diced tomatoes
- **Meats**: Diced ham, or cooked bacon
- **Herbs**: Chopped parsley, chives, or fresh basil
- 
### Notes
- **Healthier Option**: Using some egg whites reduces cholesterol and calories while keeping the omelet fluffy. Whisking heavy cream adds richness even when yolks are reduced.
- **Pro Tip**: Pre-cook raw toppings like mushrooms or peppers to remove excess moisture and enhance their flavor.
- **Customizable**: Each person can pick their own toppings for a personalized omelet experience.
