Our favorite recipe using 365 by Whole Foods Market Organic Buttermilk Pancake & Waffle Mix. Feel free to use your favorite pancake mix for this simple, delicious breakfast. Makes 6 Pancakes

### Ingredients 
- 2 cups pancake mix
- 1 1/2 cup almond milk
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- 2 eggs

### Directions
1. **Mix the Batter**:
   - In a medium bowl, combine the pancake mix, almond milk, oil, and egg. Use an electric mixer or whisk to beat the batter until smooth and no lumps remain.

2. **Heat the Griddle**:
   - Place a Lodge cast iron flat griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with cooking spray.

3. **Cook the Pancakes**:
   - Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
   - Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2–3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown, another 1–2 minutes.

4. **Serve**:
   - Stack the pancakes and serve warm with your favorite toppings.

### Optional Toppings
- **Classic**: Maple syrup, butter
- **Fruity**: Sliced bananas, fresh berries, or a dollop of fruit preserves
- **Indulgent**: Chocolate chips, whipped cream, or a drizzle of Nutella
- **Savory**: Add crumbled bacon or serve with eggs on the side

### Notes
- For a thicker batter, reduce almond milk slightly; for thinner pancakes, add a splash more.
- Extra batter can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to **24 hours**. Stir gently before using, and if it thickens, add a small splash of almond milk to return it to the desired consistency.
- These pancakes also freeze well. Let them cool completely, then stack with parchment paper in between and store in an airtight container.
