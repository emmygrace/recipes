## Cheese Quesadillas

_By Emmy Clark_  
A quick and satisfying meal or snack with crispy tortillas and gooey, melted cheese. Perfect for any time of day! Serves 4

### Ingredients 
- 4 large flour tortillas
- 2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)

### Directions
1. **Preheat the Griddle**:
   - Heat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat and spray lightly with cooking spray.

2. **Cook the Quesadilla**:
   - Place one tortilla on the griddle and cook for 20-30 seconds, then flip and cook for another 20-30 seconds until the tortilla is lightly browned.

3. **Add Cheese and Toppings**:
   - Spread shredded cheese evenly over the entire tortilla. Add any optional fillings, such as cooked chicken, black beans, diced green chiles, or sautéed vegetables.
   - Check underneath the tortilla to ensure it’s not burning while the cheese melts.

4. **Fold and Finish**:
   - Fold the tortilla in half and press gently with a spatula. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the cheese is fully melted and the tortilla is golden brown.

5. **Serve**:
   - Remove the quesadilla from the skillet and let cool slightly. Slice into wedges and serve with sour cream, guacamole, or salsa.

6. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and cheese.

### Notes
- **Crispier Quesadillas**: Press gently with a spatula while cooking to achieve a crispier texture.
- **Cheese Options**: Experiment with different cheeses like mozzarella, pepper jack, or a Mexican blend for unique flavors.
- **Storage**: Leftover quesadillas can be refrigerated for up to 2 days and reheated in a skillet or toaster oven for best results.
- **Optional Fillings**: Try cooked chicken, black beans, diced green chiles, or sautéed onions and peppers for variety.
