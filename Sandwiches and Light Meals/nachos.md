## Nachos

_By Emmy Clark_  
A quick and delicious meal or snack, loaded with layers of black beans or seasoned ground beef, melted cheese, and your favorite toppings.

### Ingredients (Serves 4)
#### Base:
- Tortilla chips (enough to cover a large baking sheet)

#### Toppings:
- 1 pound ground beef (92% lean) or 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 packet taco seasoning (or homemade)
- 2/3 cup water (for beef, per seasoning packet directions)
- 2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)
- Lettuce, shredded
- Store-bought salsa
- Sour cream
- Fresh diced jalapeños
- Black olives, sliced

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Base Topping**:
   - For **black beans**: Heat beans in a skillet with taco seasoning and a splash of water, cooking until warmed through and coated with seasoning.
   - For **ground beef**: Cook the beef in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat. Add taco seasoning and water; simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

2. **Assemble the Nachos**:
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F.
   - Spread a layer of tortilla chips evenly over a large baking sheet.
   - Sprinkle ground beef or black beans over the chips, followed by an even layer of shredded cheese.

3. **Bake the Nachos**:
   - Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

4. **Add Fresh Toppings**:
   - Remove the nachos from the oven. Top with shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream, diced jalapeños, and sliced black olives.

5. **Serve**:
   - Serve immediately on the baking sheet or transfer to a large serving platter. Provide additional toppings on the side for customization.

### Notes
- **Cheese Tip**: For extra gooeyness, layer chips, cheese, and toppings in two layers before baking.
- **Customizable**: Add guacamole, diced tomatoes, or chopped onions for additional flavors.
- **Perfect for Sharing**: Serve straight from the baking sheet for an easy, crowd-friendly presentation.
