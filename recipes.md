## Standing Prime Rib Roast  
_By Emmy Clark_  
A family tradition enjoyed on Christmas, this recipe creates a perfectly tender and flavorful prime rib, cooked to medium-rare perfection.

### Ingredients
- 2-3 lb standing prime rib roast (bone-in or boneless)
- Salt and pepper (for dry brine)

### Additional Details
#### **Choosing the Cut**:
- Look for a well-marbled rib roast from the **prime** or **choice** grades for the best flavor and tenderness.
- Bone-in rib roasts offer more flavor and help insulate the meat during cooking for even doneness. However, boneless is easier to slice.
- Purchase from a reputable butcher or high-quality grocery store. Dry-aged beef is an excellent option if available.

#### **Dry Brining**:
- Dry brining enhances flavor and tenderness by allowing the salt to penetrate the meat.
- Generously coat the roast with salt and pepper, ensuring all sides are covered.
- Place the roast on a rack over a baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered for 24 hours. This dries the surface for better browning.

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Roast**:
   - Remove the roast from the refrigerator 2 hours before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature. This ensures even cooking.

2. **Slow Roast**:
   - Preheat the oven to 250°F.
   - Place the roast on a rack in a roasting pan, fat side up. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, avoiding the bone.
   - Roast for approximately 4-5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches **128°F** for medium-rare.

3. **Rest**:
   - Remove the roast from the oven and tent loosely with foil. Let it rest for 20-30 minutes. During this time, the temperature will rise slightly due to carryover cooking.

4. **High-Heat Searing**:
   - Increase the oven temperature to 500°F. Place the roast back in the oven for about 10 minutes to develop a beautifully browned crust.

5. **Slice and Serve**:
   - Allow the roast to rest for another 10 minutes before slicing. Use a sharp carving knife to cut thin slices against the grain.
   - Serve with red wine au jus (recipe below).

### Concepts and Tips
#### **Slow Roasting**:
- Cooking at a low temperature ensures even doneness throughout the roast, avoiding overcooking the outer layers while achieving the perfect medium-rare center.

#### **Measuring Temperature**:
- Use an instant-read or leave-in meat thermometer for accuracy. Medium-rare is achieved at 130-135°F. Pulling the roast at 128°F allows for carryover cooking to finish it perfectly.
- Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bones or fat, which can give inaccurate readings.

#### **The 500°F Sear**:
- This step creates a rich, flavorful crust by caramelizing the meat's surface. It's done after slow roasting to avoid overcooking the interior.

### Serving and Accompaniments
#### **Slicing Tips**:
- Let the roast rest after searing to allow juices to redistribute.
- Slice against the grain for tender bites. For bone-in roasts, cut along the bone to separate it, then slice the meat.

#### **Accompaniments**:
- Serve with a **red wine au jus**: Deglaze the roasting pan with red wine and beef stock, simmer, and strain.
- Pair with creamy mashed potatoes, green beans almondine, or Yorkshire pudding for a classic holiday feast.

### Notes
- Adjust cooking times for larger or smaller roasts; aim for 30 minutes per pound at 250°F.
- Leftovers make excellent sandwiches with horseradish sauce or can be repurposed in soups and stews.

# Breakfast

## Fluffy Omelet  
_By Emmy Clark_  
A creamy and fluffy omelet perfect for family breakfasts or sleepovers. Customize it with your favorite toppings! Serves 3

### Ingredients 
- 4-5 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Eggs**:
   - Crack the eggs into a bowl.
   - Whisk the eggs (and whites, if using) with the heavy cream, salt, and pepper until smooth and slightly frothy.

2. **Cook the Omelet**:
   - Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add cooking spray or butter.
   - Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and let it cook undisturbed for about 1 minute.
   - Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the omelet, allowing uncooked egg to flow underneath.

3. **Add Toppings**:
   - Sprinkle your desired toppings (e.g., cheese, vegetables, meats) evenly over one half of the omelet.
   - Continue cooking 2-3 minutes until the eggs are set but still slightly soft on top.

4. **Fold and Serve**:
   - Use the spatula to gently fold the omelet in half over the toppings.

- **Customizable**: Each person can pick their own toppings for a personalized omelet experience.
