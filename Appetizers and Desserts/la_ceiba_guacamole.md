### Ingredients
- 6 avocados
- 3 limes, juiced
- 1 apple, finely chopped
- 1 habanero chile, finely chopped
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 5 tablespoons mint leaves, chopped
- Salt, to taste
- **Optional**: Pomegranate seeds for garnish

### Directions
1. In a bowl, mix the red onion, chile, apple, mint, and salt. Let it rest for at least 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
2. Add the lime juice and stir well until the salt dissolves.
3. Add the avocados and mix gently with a spoon until you achieve a thick and chunky consistency. **Do not mash the guacamole.**
4. Taste and adjust salt or lime juice if needed.
5. Optionally, top with pomegranate seeds for a pop of color and flavor.
6. Serve with crispy corn tortilla chips and enjoy!

### Notes
- The sweetness of the apple and mint balances the heat of the habanero, creating a unique twist on traditional guacamole.
- For less heat, remove the seeds and veins from the habanero.
- This recipe is perfect for parties but can also elevate any meal.
