## Whipped Cream

_By Emmy Clark_  
A light and fluffy homemade whipped cream, perfect for topping desserts or enjoying on its own.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or hazelnut extract

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Ingredients**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla or hazelnut extract.
   
2. **Whip the Cream**:
   - Using a whisk, hand mixer, or stand mixer, beat the mixture on medium-high speed for about 3 minutes, or until soft peaks form.
   - Be careful not to overwhip, as the cream can turn into butter.

3. **Serve**:
   - Use immediately as a topping for desserts like pies, cakes, or hot chocolate.
   - Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, rewhipping gently if needed.

### Notes
- **Make It Your Own**: Adjust the sweetness by adding more or less sugar to taste.
- **Flavored Whipped Cream**: Experiment with other extracts, such as almond or peppermint, for a unique twist.
