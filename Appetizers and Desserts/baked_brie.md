## Baked Brie

_By Emmy Clark_  
A deliciously gooey and festive appetizer, perfect for holiday gatherings or special occasions.

### Ingredients
- 1 round brie
- 1 cup cranberry sauce
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 egg (for egg wash)
- Crackers, for serving

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Puff Pastry**:
   - Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
   - Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and place the brie in the center.

2. **Assemble**:
   - Spread the cranberry sauce evenly over the top of the brie.
   - Fold the puff pastry over the brie, overlapping the edges to fully enclose it. Trim any excess pastry if needed.

3. **Apply Egg Wash**:
   - Beat the egg and brush it over the folded puff pastry to help it turn golden brown during baking.

4. **Bake**:
   - Place the wrapped brie on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
   - Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and crispy.

5. **Serve**:
   - Let the baked brie rest for 5-10 minutes before serving to allow the cheese to settle.
   - Serve warm with crackers, sliced baguette, or fresh fruit.

### Notes
- **Make It Your Own**: Substitute cranberry sauce with apricot jam, fig preserves, or honey for a different flavor profile.
- **Garnish**: Add a sprinkle of chopped nuts (like pecans or walnuts) to the cranberry sauce for added texture.
