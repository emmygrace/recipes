Crispy and flavorful chicken wings made effortlessly in the air fryer, perfect for game days or a quick snack. Pair with homemade blue cheese dressing for the ultimate experience.

### Ingredients
- 1-2 pounds chicken wings
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons corn starch
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons pepper
- 2 teaspoons garlic salt
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- 2 tablespoons hot sauce

### Directions
1. **Prepare the Wings**:
   - In a large bowl, pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels.
   - Add the baking powder and corn starch to the wings and toss to coat evenly.
   - Chill the wings in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to help them crisp up.

2. **Season the Wings**:
   - Remove the wings from the refrigerator. Add the salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, smoked paprika, EVOO, and hot sauce to the bowl. Toss to coat the wings evenly.

3. **Cook the Wings**:
   - Preheat the air fryer to 400°F.
   - Arrange the wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket, ensuring they are not overcrowded.
   - Cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through cooking, until they are golden brown and crispy.

4. **Serve**:
   - Remove the wings from the air fryer and let rest for 2-3 minutes.
   - Serve hot with homemade blue cheese dressing or your favorite dipping sauce.

### Notes
- **For Extra Crispiness**: Patting the wings dry and using baking powder are key to achieving a crispy texture.
- **Storage**: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 350°F for 5-7 minutes.
- **Variations**: Customize with your favorite wing sauces or dry rubs after cooking.
