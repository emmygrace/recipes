## Mashed Potatoes

_By Emmy Clark_  
Creamy, buttery mashed potatoes with a rich texture, perfect as a side dish for any meal.

### Ingredients
- 5 pounds potatoes (russet or Yukon gold recommended)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 12 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions
1. **Bake the Potatoes**:
   - Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
   - Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for about 50 minutes, or until tender and easily pierced with a fork.
2. **Scoop and Mash**:
   - Remove the potatoes from the oven. Once cool enough to handle, scoop the insides into a large bowl.
   - Mash the potatoes until smooth or your desired consistency.
3. **Prepare the Mixture**:
   - In a small saucepan, gently heat the heavy cream and butter until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm.
4. **Combine and Serve**:
   - Pour the cream and butter mixture into the mashed potatoes. Gently fold until combined, being careful not to overmix.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Serve warm.

### Notes
- **Tips for Creaminess**: For extra smooth potatoes, use a potato ricer or food mill instead of mashing.
- **Variations**: Add roasted garlic, chives, or grated Parmesan for additional flavor.
- **Make Ahead**: Keep mashed potatoes warm in a slow cooker or reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of cream or milk.
