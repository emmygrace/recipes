## Green Beans Almondine

_By Emmy Clark_  
A simple and elegant side dish featuring tender green beans, buttery almonds, and a hint of garlic and lemon.

### Ingredients
- 1 pound green beans, trimmed
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Lemon juice, to taste

### Directions
1. **Blanch the Green Beans**:
   - Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
   - Boil the green beans for 3-5 minutes until bright green and tender-crisp.
   - Drain and immediately transfer the beans to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.

2. **Toast the Almonds**:
   - In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
   - Add the sliced almonds and sauté until lightly golden and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

3. **Sauté the Garlic**:
   - Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for another 1 minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning.

4. **Combine and Season**:
   - Add the green beans to the skillet and toss to coat in the buttery almond mixture.
   - Season with salt and pepper, then drizzle with fresh lemon juice to taste.

5. **Serve**:
   - Transfer to a serving dish and enjoy immediately.

### Notes
- **Make Ahead**: Blanch the green beans a day ahead and store them in the refrigerator. Sauté with the almond mixture just before serving.
- **Variations**: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat or top with grated Parmesan for extra flavor.
