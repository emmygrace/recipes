_By serendipity needleworks_  
A creamy, sweet, and savory Southern-style side dish that's perfect for any occasion.

### Ingredients
- 15oz can yellow cream corn
- 2 eggs, slightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 cup Pet evaporated milk
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Paprika (optional, for garnish)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 300°F (increase to 325°F for faster cooking if needed).
2. In a large bowl, mix all ingredients together until smooth and well combined.
3. Pour the mixture into a greased (butter preferred) shallow casserole dish.
4. Sprinkle paprika on top for color, if desired.
5. Bake until set. The exact baking time depends on the depth of the casserole.

### Notes
- For a deeper casserole dish, bake at a lower temperature and increase cooking time for even baking.
- Adjust sweetness and seasoning (sugar, salt, pepper) to taste before baking.
