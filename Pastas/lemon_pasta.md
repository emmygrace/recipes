## Lemon Pasta

_From Dinner and a Movie, Phish, Chef unknown_  

A tangy, creamy pasta dish that’s simple, comforting, and perfect for any occasion. Inspired by a weekly movie series from the band Phish during the COVID-19 pandemic. A family favorite, first enjoyed on New Year's Eve.

### Ingredients (Serves 4)
- 12 oz wide egg noodles
- 2 small/medium lemons (zest and juice)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Salt, to taste
- Lots of freshly ground black pepper

### Directions
1. **Cook the Noodles**:
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the wide egg noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and return to the pot.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**:
   - Just before the noodles are done, combine the lemon zest, heavy cream, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan.
   - Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until the cream just comes to a boil.

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**:
   - Pour the cream mixture over the drained noodles in the pot. Add the lemon juice and stir to coat the noodles evenly.

4. **Cook and Absorb**:
   - Place the pot over medium heat and stir continuously until the liquid is absorbed, about 1-2 minutes.

5. **Season and Serve**:
   - Adjust seasoning with additional black pepper if desired.
   - Serve immediately and enjoy!

### Notes
- **Optional Additions**:
  - **Vegetables**: Toss in baby arugula, roasted broccoli or broccolini (chopped and roasted at 400°F for 15 minutes with olive oil), steamed or sautéed asparagus, or fresh herbs like parsley or chives.
  - **Cheese**: Add freshly grated Parmesan for extra richness.
- **Storage**: Best enjoyed fresh, but leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently with a splash of cream or olive oil.

This dish shines on its own or can be dressed up with veggies and herbs to make it your own!
