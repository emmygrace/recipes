_By Emmy Clark_  
A simple yet flavorful Italian dish made with spaghetti, garlic, and olive oil, perfect for a quick and satisfying meal.

### Ingredients (Serves 4)
- 12 oz spaghetti
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Lemon zest (optional, for garnish)

### Directions
1. **Cook the Pasta**:
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.
   - Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**:
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the garlic slices and cook gently until golden and fragrant (2-3 minutes). Be careful not to burn the garlic.
   - Add the red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds.

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**:
   - Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet, tossing to coat the noodles in the garlic oil.
   - Gradually add the reserved pasta water, a few tablespoons at a time, to create a light sauce. Toss continuously until the pasta is evenly coated.

4. **Season and Garnish**:
   - Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
   - Toss in fresh parsley or sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if using.
   - Garnish with lemon zest for a bright finish, if desired.

5. **Serve**:
   - Divide into bowls and serve immediately. Enjoy warm with extra Parmesan on the side.

### Notes
- **Customize It**: Add cooked shrimp or saut√©ed mushrooms for variety.
- **Storage**: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat gently with a splash of water or olive oil.
- **Pro Tip**: Use high-quality olive oil and fresh garlic for the best flavor.
